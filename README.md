GHOST(.DETRITUS.WEBSITE)
===========

A small piece of hacked-together garbage that I made a few months ago. Originally sitting at http://detritus.website/ghost, am porting it to GitHub Pages to

1. Learn how to use GitHub Pages and
2. Make it easier for my to make it less garbage, ex. I think it's jQuery right now but it might still be PHP, let's find out together!

Will also be sitting at http://ghost.detritus.website b/c subdomains.

OH RIGHT WHAT IS IT

Serves a random (from a prearranged assortment, though that might change?) gif from the movie *Ghost* while also playing the intro to Ginuwine's "Pony" on loop.
